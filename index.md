I'm working as a senior machine learning engineer at Qualcomm AI Research. I completed a PhD in computer science in the 
[Geometric Computing Lab](https://cims.nyu.edu/gcl/)
at the [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences](http://cims.nyu.edu).
I also studied mathematics at the [University at Buffalo - SUNY]( http://www.math.buffalo.edu).

I'm interested in topics at the intersection of computation and mathematics.
Recently, I've been working on problems in  geometry processing, computational topology, physics-based simulation, linear algebra and optimization.
Some recent projects include: fast distributed spatial queries, a parallel PDE solver, Bezier and spline algorithms, collision detection and handling, and optimal distance algorithms in the curve graph.
I'm also interested in reproducibility and good engineering practices in computational science.
